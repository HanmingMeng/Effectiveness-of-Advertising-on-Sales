# Effectiveness-of-Advertising-on-Sales
Designed a dynamic model (including lag 1 period sales) to investigate the relationship between relevant online and offline marketing channels and sales for a company and attribute the effect for each channel and synergy effect

In this project, we developed a model to determine the effectiveness of all marketing activities using the campaign data for a cosmetic product as a proof of concept. We sought to optimize this firm’s marketing strategies by recommending the adoption of an updated marketing versus sales model. To do so, we utilized the firm’s focal model to investigate the relationship between relevant marketing channels and sales in different aggregation levels, as well as the robustness of this model. With the results, we provided managerial recommendations and insights on the limitations of the focal model. Specifically, we explored whether synergy exists in the firm’s marketing mix and explained the reason for its absence. Discovering that the distributions of many potentially informative variables are not normally distributed, we suggest that the model be transformed and more data be included .
